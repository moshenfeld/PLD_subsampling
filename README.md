### PLD subsampling experiments

Implements and evaluates privacy amplification by subsampling for Privacy Loss Distribution (PLD) probability mass functions (PMFs). Generates CDF plots and epsilon ratio plots comparing analytical ground truth, dp-accounting, and our direct subsampling implementation.

### Structure

- `subsample_pld_pmf.py`: Core subsampling primitives
  - `stable_subsampling_loss`: numerically stable loss mapping
  - `exclusive_ccdf_from_pdf`: CCDF helper (exclusive tail)
  - `subsample_losses`: transforms a PMF on a uniform loss grid
  - `dp_accounting_pmf_to_loss_probs` / `loss_probs_to_dp_accounting_pmf`: bridge utilities
- `analytic_derivation.py`: Analytical PLD and epsilon(Î´) formulas
- `dp_accounting_wrappers.py`: Thin wrappers around dp-accounting (construct PLDs, amplify PLDs separately for remove/add)
- `pmf_compare.py`: Comparison metrics (Wasserstein-1)
- `test_utils.py`: Builds method variants for experiments
- `plot_utils.py`: Plotting (CDF with focused x-range, epsilon ratio)
- `main.py`: Runs experiments and saves figures to `plots/`

### Quickstart

1) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Run experiments and generate plots

```bash
python main.py
```

Figures are written to `plots/` (treat this directory as build output).

### Notes

- CDF plots automatically focus the main x-axis on the transition region and add slight y-padding to show the 0 and 1 limits clearly.
- Epsilon-ratio plots show method/GT vs analytical epsilon over log-scale epsilon.
- All heavy computations use vectorized NumPy operations with careful numerical handling in tail regions.
